This is a single green algae that reproduces quickly with only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a few minerals. It was researched in the 1940’s as a possible “**superfood**” to provide the necessary nutrition to a booming population. It was discovered that it is relatively difficult to cultivate and looses its nutritional value when processed. 

Recently, however, interest in **chlorella** has grown, specifically for using it to **boost the immune system and detoxification.**

Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal disorder with an unknown etiology. Some patients have used many therapies to reduce its symptoms, including ingesting great quantities of the macronutrients found in **chlorella.** One randomized controlled trial and one case series indicate that **chlorella** may reduce the tenderness associated with fibromyalgia’s tender points.

## Scientific Findings

**Chlorella** has been shown to selectively boost antibody responses.  The bulk immunostimulatory activity is found in the polysaccharide/protein complexes composed primarily of galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose.

A double blind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial revealed that daily dietary supplementation may:

* Reduce high blood pressure
* Lower serum cholesterol
* Accelerate wound healing
* Enhance immune function
 
**Chlorella** contains monogalactosyl diacylglycerols that have shown an inhibitory effect to tumor promotion.

It contains a compound called Immurella which shows immunostimulatory activity by substantially increasing mRNA levels leading to production of IL-1β and TNF-α in THP-1 human monocytes/macrophages.

#### Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE's)

AGE’s are implicated in many pathological events throughout the body.

They have been known to progress at an accelerated rate under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes implicating them in the complications of diabetes.

AGE’s are also implicated in many pathological sequelae of diabetes and aging such as atherosclerosis and diabetic microangiopathy.

They are also involved in neurodegenerative diseases as well as melanoma growth, expansion, and metastasis.

Chlorella has been shown to inhibit the formation of AGE’s in vitro thereby reducing the pathological sequelae that they cause.
