**Maca** is a vegetable that has been cultivated as a root crop for at least 2000 years. It has been traditionally used as a food source, to **relieve stress**, as an aphrodisiac, and for **fertility enhancement** in males and females.

Recently commercial maca products have gained popularity as dietary supplements with claims of **boosting energy, enhancing fertility, balancing hormones**, as an **aphrodisiac**, and **enhancing sexual performance.**

Soon after the Spanish conquest in South America, the Spaniards discovered their livestock were reproducing poorly in the highlands. The local natives recommended feeding the animals maca and the results were so remarkable that the Spanish chroniclers wrote in-depth reports about the root.

It is also reported that ancient Incan warriors would take maca before going into battle to improve their **strength and stamina.**

Maca is considered an adaptogen which is defined as a plant or plant material that promotes non-specific benefits to an organism while inducing no negative side effects.

**Maca** has been found to contain many therapeutic compounds.

Studies have shown that **maca** increases sexual desire and libido while having no effect on the levels of estradiol and testosterone in the body. It has been shown to be chondroprotective by blocking catabolic inflammatory events associated with arthritis and enhancing sustained anabolic activity. 1-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid is reported to exert many activities on the CNS which can promote better mood. **Maca** alkaloids, steroids, glucosinolates, isothicyanates, and macromides are probably responsible for its aptitude to act as a fertility enhancer, aphrodisiac, adaptogen, immunostimulant, anabolic and to influence hormonal balance. Higher doses of ethanol extracts from maca was shown effective in the prevention of estrogen deficient bone loss.

### Sexual Benefits of Maca

In a study on healthy adult males it was shown that **maca** resulted in increased seminal fluid volume, sperm count per ejaculum, motile sperm count, and sperm motility. This indicated an improved sperm production and motility by mechanisms not related to LH, FSH, PRL, testosterone, and E2.

A separate study on healthy adult males indicated that **maca** improved sexual desire after 8 weeks of supplementation. This increased libido also did not have any effect on testosterone or estradiol levels.

A animal study using rats showed a reduced prostate size in the male rats treated with **maca.**

Fifty percent of the U.S. male population have some degree of erectile dysfunction. **Maca** has shown evidence that it may be helpful for erectile dysfunction by improving penile endothelial L-arginine-nitrous oxide activity.

## Other Effects of Maca

Cartilage loss is a hallmark of arthritis and follows activation of catabolic processes concomitant with a disruption of anabolic pathways like IGF-1. **Maca** along with another ingredient of **Might Maca,** Catâ€™s claw, has been shown to be chondroprotective by blocking catabolic inflammatory events associated with arthritis and enhancing sustained anabolic activity.

-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid is reported to exert many activities on the CNS which can promote better mood.

**Maca** alkaloids, steroids, glucosinolates, isothicyanates, and macromides are probably responsible for its aptitude to act as a fertility enhancer, aphrodisiac, adaptogen, immunostimulant, anabolic and to influence hormonal balance.

Higher doses of ethanol extracts from **maca** was shown effective in the prevention of estrogen deficient bone loss.
