# So, you want to get promoted?

Welcome to the document that will fulfill all of your dreams and curiosities about becoming a higher-ranking individual on Fleet of Thieves. Before you rank up, you have to meet the prerequisites of the rank. Every rank in this document has the requirements listed for you to rank up. **Once you meet the prerequisites, do /promote in #bot-commands along with a screenshot of your faction levels.** For all of the Fleet member ranks, all you have to do to rank up is meet these requirements and post a screenshot in #bot-commands. For all Officer ranks, you must schedule an appointment with a Pirate Captain to sail with them so they can meet you and test your ability as a pirate before you become an officer. It is important to not be scared away from assumed difficulty. The prerequisites are simply designed around you naturally being an active and caring member of the game and the clan.


First Mate is obtained through a Pirate Captain inviting you to become their First Mate with the Council’s approval. **You must be a First Mate before becoming a Pirate Captain.** Quartermasters can not become Pirate Captains. You must have the rank of Boatswain in order to be chosen as a First Mate. **Once you are the rank of Boatswain, you can choose next to either wait for an opportunity to become First Mate, or test later to become a Quartermaster.** Quartermasters have more authority than First Mates in a crew, but they have no active mentoring styled responsibilities the way Pirate Captains and First Mates do.


The ranks Commodore and above are purely management and administrative, and have ultimate say when they are needed in situations that call for them. The highest rank that should be needed day-to-day in the clan is Pirate Captain. To compare the fleet to a business, imagine Commodore+ as district managers/corporate staff and Boatswain+ as store managers.

**Clarification for ranking up:** "Faction levels must equal X" means your faction levels to rank up can be any combination of numbers to equal at least the number required. For 50, it could be 20-20-10, 15-15-20, 10-0-40, it is completely up to how you decide to level yourself up.

<div class="title" style="color: #c05858;">*Pirate Captain*</div> The rank many aspire to be. Most clan members will never reach this rank and it is designed that way as it holds a lot of power, reputation, and responsibility. Pirate Captains are supposed to be experts in Sea of Thieves as well as being mature and capable of training/testing other clan members through our ranks.You will be responsible for being a direct "manager" over training clanmates through the ranks as well as keeping up with the documentation that comes with that responsibility. **You can be dropped out of this rank if you do not demonstrate reasonable activity or an excuse to lack of activity.** Here are the requirements to test for Pirate Captain:

<div class="title" style="color: #048805;">*Commodore*</div> Commodores are responsible for managing the Pirate Captain program. This means that you can only be promoted to this role if you are currently a Pirate Captain. Promotions to this role will be conducted by the Admirals from the pool of Pirate Captains should a vacancy occur... **You can be dropped out of this rank if you do not demonstrate reasonable activity or an excuse to lack of activity.**

<div class="title" style="color: #1cb822;">*Vice Admiral*</div> The Vice Admiral is third in command to the Fleet Admiral. This is the final rank that holds a strong authority over the entire clan and structure.

<div class="title" style="color: #8adc82;">*Admiral*</div> The Admiral is second in command to the Fleet Admiral. They are also an ultimate authority over the clan and structure, and have sailing authority on any fleet ship they participate in. The spot is filled by whoever the Vice Admiral is when a vacancy is made. **You can be dropped out of this rank if you do not demonstrate reasonable activity or an excuse to lack of activity.**

<div class="title" style="color: #a3ffb0;">*Fleet Admiral*</div> This is the top rank of Fleet of Thieves. It can only be held by one person, and they have ultimate authority over the clan and structure. The Fleet Admiral is the first in command on absolutely any ship they are sailing on when it consists of clan members, including a Pirate Captain’s own ship. Should a vacancy ever occur, a server-wide vote would determine the new Fleet Admiral. The only people eligible for that vote would have to be both at least a Pirate Captain and a member of the Pirate Council.
