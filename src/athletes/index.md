## Mighty Maca is in his corner!

## Cruiserweight Champion Jason Robinson

Cruiserweight Champion Jason Robinson is a big fan of Mighty Maca (MM)!  He mixes 2 - 3 scoops in his water bottle after his training sessions as a recovery drink and tells us he is less sore and able to workout quicker, with less pain.  He gives MM credit for being able to train harder and longer than before he began taking it.  Additionally, Jason has more energy and feels overall better and healthier! "I love it" he says with his hearty and joyous laugh.  Jason also says that he does not like the way typical energy drinks make him feel, so he was looking for an all-natural alternative. Finally, Jason tells us that "Mighty Maca has so many benefits...it's really a no-brainer for me.""

"I take a scoop of MM first thing in the morning before my workout to fuel my body with quality nutrients and at night after my evening training to help my body recover and repair. I can feel a huge difference in inflammation and overall energy levels if I miss even a day. You only have one life and one body -why not give it the best fuel to thrive?"

## Ironman Jason Rogers

Jason served in the military for 7 years and I now work in corrections. He has been training on the bike for about 10 years and has competed in ironman triathlons and marathons.

Jason recently organized and completed the COAST-2-COAST WARRIOR RIDE...a 2,500 mile bike ride from San Diego, CA to St. Simons Island, GA to raise awareness and funds for the Wounded Warrior Project.  Jason took Mighty Maca during this venture and reported better energy during his 28 days of 100 mile rides.
