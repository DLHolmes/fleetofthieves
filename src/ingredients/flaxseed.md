Flaxseed products are used widely for numerous indications. The expert German panel, the Commission E, has approved the use of flax for chronic constipation, laxative-damaged colon, irritable bowel, diverticulitis, gastritis, and enteritis.

Western diets low in the essential fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acid, which are found in flax seed, play an important role in the causation of atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, multiple sclerosis, triopathy of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and neuropathy as well as certain forms of malignant disease.

* Cardiovascular
    * Many studies have shown the cardioprotective effects of flax seed. Flax seed has the highest content of any natural product of the essential fatty acid linolenic acid which has demonstrated cardioprotection and decreased platelet aggregation. Flax has also shown reduction in blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL, and LDL/HDL ratio.
    * Separate investigations have seen a decrease in overall mortality, mortality due to MI and sudden death in coronary heart disease as well as protection against fatal ischemic heart disease.

* Anti-inflammatory
    * Flax seed is high in omega-3-fatty acids, which are known to suppress the production of IL-1, TNF, LTB4, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes thereby decreasing inflammation. This is partly done through the inactivation of LTA epoxide hydrolase and independently blocking LTB4 and PAF stimulated chemotaxis by attenuating the formation of IP3 through modifying P1-selective phospholipase C.
    * Flax seed also shunts intermediates away from the arachidonic acid pathway which produces pro-inflammatory leukotrienes, and into the production of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which are anti-inflammatory eicosanoids.
    * This is thought to be the mechanism by which flax seed plays a role in protecting against lung disease.

* Other
    * Flax seed induces a rise in arterial compliance which leads to functional improvement in systemic arterial circulation.
    * It has potent anti-platelet activity which least to a reduction of heart disease and stroke.
    * Flax seed reduces the levels of postprandial glucose.
    * In a large study on people suffering from migraines, those supplemented with flax seed claimed a reduction in severity, frequency, and duration as well as a reduction in nausea and vomiting.
