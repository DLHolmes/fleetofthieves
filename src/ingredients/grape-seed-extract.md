Grape leaves, sap, seed, and fruit have purportedly been used medicinally since the time of the ancient Greeks. 

Preparations from different parts of the plant have been use historically to treat a variety of ailments, including skin and eye irritation, bleeding, varicose veins, diarrhea, cancer, and smallpox.

Gallic acid is the major active component found in grape seed extract. It is considered a proanthocyanidin.

It is considered a superior antioxidant to vitamin C, E and beta-carotene.

* Its antioxidant effects are mediated through the inhibition of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical which are potent scavengers of oxygen free radicals.
* It also reduces 8-isoprostane formation, providing antioxidant protection
* Significantly reduces the amount of oxidized LDL which is a byproduct of free radical formation. LDL is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease.

It is also thought to inhibit cancer cells by inhibiting cell growth, causing cell cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis.

* One mechanism by which this occurs is by reducing cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins.
* It is also an inhibitor of aromatase which reduces androgen dependent tumor growth.
