## (Uncaria Tomentosa)

<img class="right-img" src="/images/una-de-gato.png"> 
**Una de Gato (aka Cat’s claw, from the thorns on the plant's leaves that look like the claws of a cat)** was originally found in Peru and its use dates back to the Incan civilization, possibly as far back as 2,000 years. It has been used as an **anti-inflammatory** and immunostimulant, for **cancer treatment** and as an **anti-viral.** In the U.S. today it is widely used and is one of the top-selling herbal remedies.

#### Anti-inflammatory

Cat’s Claw has been thoroughly researched as an anti-inflammatory. One mechanism by which it works is by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α by inhibiting the MAP kinase signaling pathway and to a lesser extent by inhibiting PGE2.

It is also a potent free radical scavenger through the proanthocyanidins found within it.

It has demonstrated in human studies to produce substantial improvement in pain, stiffness, and function in patients with osteoarthritis.

A double blind study showed high response rates and an excellent safety profile.

As discussed previously within the maya section, it is also chondroprotective.

It has been proven to relieve tender joints in rheumatoid arthritis.

Cat’s Claw protects cells against oxidative stress by negating the activation of NF-kappa B.

Anti-cancer

It has shown anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of human lymphoblastic leukemic cells.

Some of its pro-apoptotic effects are induced through activation of caspase 3.

Demonstrated growth inhibition in both glioma and neuroblastoma.

C-med-100, a component of Cat’s Claw, reduced skin cell death from UV exposure by inducing DNA repair in skin cells. It also showed DNA repair enhancement and leukocyte recovery to prevent mutagenesis.

It demonstrates anti-mutagenic effects in normal human tissue and pro-mutagenic effects in cancer tissue.

Showed a direct anti-proliferative activity in human breast cancer cell line MCF7.

Induces DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis in cancer cells.

Immunostimulant

C-med-100 showed a statistically significant immune enhancement and elevation in lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios.

Cat’s Claw greatly stimulates IL-1 and IL-6 production in alveolar macrophages further demonstrating its immunostimulatory effects.

It has proven to have a high antioxidant capacity.

Lastly, it enhances B and T cell proliferation.

Antimicrobial and antiviral

Studies results listed a high antimicrobial effect against Enterobacteraceae, S. mutans, and Stpahylococcus.

GIT protectant

In vitro Cat’s Claw limited the amount of epithelial cell death in gastrointestinal tissue in response to oxidative stress. This cytoprotective response is thought to be from actions on intercellular pathways regulating cell death.
