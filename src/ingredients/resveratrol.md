Resveratrol is a naturally occurring hydroxystilbene identified in over 70 plant species including nuts, grapes, pine trees, and certain vines, as well as red wine. It is thought to play a role in the prevention of heart disease. 

It is being investigated today in the “French Paradox”, the finding that coronary artery disease mortality in France is lower than observed in other industrialized nations. The hypothesis is that the consumption of red wine which contains resveratrol is a natural protectant for coronary arteries.
