Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates or starches in the body. It is present in saliva, and begins the process of chemical digestion in the body. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but very little sugar, such as rice and potato, can often taste sweet as they are chewed because amylase turns the starch into sugar in the mouth.

The pancreas also makes amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyze dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Amylase is used in Mighty Maca Greens to aide in healthy digestion.
