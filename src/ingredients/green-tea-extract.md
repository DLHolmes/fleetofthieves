Green Tes is a source of caffeine, a methylxanthine, which stimulates the central nervous system, relaxes smooth muscle in the airway to the lungs, stimulates the heart, and acts on the kidney as a diuretic (increasing urine production). It is used as an antioxidant for chronic disease prevention as well. It has also been studied for weight loss.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major polyphenol found in green tea and is the most studied and most active component of green tea.

#### Anti-cancer Benefits:

* EGCG causes cell cycle deregulation and apoptosis of cancer cells by down regulating NF-kappa β.

- This also decreases IL-1β and INF-γ.
 
And causes a decrease in expression of the pro-oncogenic gene Bcl-2.

The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio changed favoring apoptosis instead of proliferation.

* It causes an upregulation of p53.
* Induces activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9.
* A prospective cohort study done in China showed that the risk of colon cancer was significantly reduced with the consumption of green tea.
* Pretreatment of human skin with EGCG was found to restore the UV induced decrease in total glutathione and afforded protection to the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase.
* EGCG stops the pRb-E2F/DP pathway causing an anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect.
* It blocks VEGF receptors thereby suppressing tumor angiogenesis.

#### Weight Loss

* Green tea is considered a natural product for the treatment of obesity.
* In a human clinical trial green tea was shown to induce a greater decrease in body weight, body mass index, body fat ratio, body fat mass, waist and hip circumference, and greater decrease in systolic blood pressure and reduction in serum LDL.
* It was shown in several other studies to promote weight and fat loss.

Protection against Heart Attack and Stroke

* EGCG shows an inherent capacity to inhibit atherosclerotic lesions

- This is achieved through the down regulation of the genes favoring atherosclerosis including PPAR-γ CD36, LXR- and C-myc
 
- And the upregulation of anti-atherosclerotic genes LDL-R and PPAR-α.
 
* A prospective study done on green tea drinkers in china showed a lower incidence of coronary artery disease.
* A separate study showed a decreased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality.
* The antioxidant properties found in green tea reduce the amount of LDL oxidation thereby protecting the cardiovascular system against oxidative stress and atherosclerotic plaque formation.
* It also inhibits the formation of atherosclerotic lesions by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation and function through p53 and NF-kappa β.
* EGCG has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation thereby decreasing clot formation and preventing CVS disease such as heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism.
 
Reduction in the signs of Osteoporosis

* Osteoporosis is a leading concern for the growing elderly population in the U.S. Green tea has shown some benefits to bone health.
* One study showed greater bone mass density measurements at the lumbar spine, greater trochanter, and ward’s triangle on patient supplemented with green tea.
* A separate study demonstrated that habitual consumption of green tea has significant beneficial effects on the bone mass density of total body, hip, and lumbar regions.
* In a separate but related area EGCG afforded protection against IL-1β induced production of catabolic mediators NO and PGE2 in human chondrocytes, leading to the inhibition of cartilage resorption in osteoarthritis.
