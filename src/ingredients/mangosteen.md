associated with **cancer treatment** and as a **general antioxidant.**

It contains many active phytochemicals. One set of these compounds, the prenylated xanthones, has been well researched. There are several in vitro studies showing anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory effects.

* Polysaccharides in the extract can stimulate phagocytic cells and kill intracellular bacteria by stimulating superoxide production.
* Studies have shown a strong inhibitory effect on Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis demonstrating the anti-bacterial efficacy

In human breast adenocarcinoma cells, it was observed to have an antiproliferative activity.

Individual Components: 

* A-mangostin
    * Has shown to be a histominergic blocking agent
    * Had indicated non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 protease
    * Potent antibacterial activity against MRSA and MSSA
    * Thought to inhibit human leukemia cell line HL60 by halting cell growth through apoptosis induced by mitochrondrial damage.
* B-mangostin
* y-mangostin
    * A serotonuric receptor blocking agent
    * Non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 protease
* Garcinone-E-methoxy-beta-mangostin
    * Demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects on all HCC cell lines as well as other gastric and lung cancer cells.
* 3-hydroxyl-4-geranyl-5-menthoxbiphenyl
