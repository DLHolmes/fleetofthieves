**Select your trainer wisely**

-Do not discredit a trainer due to his age or appearance.  Often times people flock to the one who displays a sexy outward appearance with zero regard to their level of expertise, commitment to clients, internal motivators, or EXPERIENCE.  Do your homework and carefully select your fitness coach.  You wouldn’t just hire the hottest brain surgeon so what makes your body any less valuable.

-Do not select the cheapest trainer (or the most expensive).  Again do your homework and select based on common sense and whether you will work well with this person.  Check certifications, past client reviews, and if they are truly invested in YOU or your wallet.

-Do they follow their own advice:  do they value others, do they commit themselves to higher goals, check their nutrition and respect for their own body.

**Never skip breakfast.**

* When you skip breakfast, you may feel starved later and be tempted to reach for a quick fix — such as candy or doughnuts. The prolonged fasting that occurs when you skip breakfast can increase your body's insulin response, which in turn increases fat storage and weight gain. Set your body up for success not fatigue.

* Breakfast is essential but some people do not have the stomach for it.  Do what you can and make a protein drink or drink Mighty Maca Greens (available in products section of website) mixed with some juice.  That’s what I drink if I have an early client or workout to fuel my morning until my appetite catches up with me.

### Eat Fat to Lose Fat.

* Healthy fats are essential to the body releasing its stored adipose tissue.

* Low-Fat is one reason why this country is in such a mess health wise.

* There are two ways to reduce fat storage in the body: 1. Is to starve it - which brings a lowering of the metabolism and fat-storage. 2. Is to feed the body in such a way that it thinks that food is plentiful and readily available.

* If there is NO fat in the diet, our bodies re-program and begin fat storage. The key is to have enough fat, frequently enough, and keep the metabolism going.

### Reduce SUGAR

* One of the few things that has zero health benefit (actually poisons) and should be reduced is sugar. It does not occur readily in nature- our craving for it is learned and can be unlearned. Sugar is majority fructose, and the fructose molecule does not metabolize in the body very well. Most of it winds up in the liver - where its chemical formula means that it will mainly wind up as fat.  This process reduces leptin which is a signal in the body for satiety. Studies suggest that is it more addictive to the body than cocaine.  Since I have not grabbed a Hersey’s Kiss full of cocaine lately, I would not know.

* When you are craving sweets, sprinkling cinnamon over yogurt, actually tricks the brain into thinking its eating sweets. When we crave sugary sweets, there is a chemical hormone that is sent from our brain making us actually crave the sweets. Cinnamon actually curbs that chemical hormone and makes you feel satisfied.

### Open your mind to the wisdom of your elders and other ethnicity.

People are in your life for many reasons and one is for you to get the opportunity to learn all you can from their experiences. 

### Keep a journal

* Alongside of what you eat write out why you ate it.  Stress, anxiety, loneliness, disappointment, boredom and even excitement can fuel cravings for particular foods. You may crave food as a means of distraction from stressful situations -- or crave comfort foods you enjoyed as a child when you miss loved ones. If your emotions are closely linked to your eating habits, you may crave and reach for snack foods without even realizing the emotional influences at play.

### Create a vision board

* Quotations, pictures that inspire, achievements, colors that energize or relax you.

**Surround yourself with people you respect and respect you**
 
**Reward yourself.  Not just because but when you deserve it. Massage, Bubble bath, special treat, etc.**
 

**BE REAL**

* Mentally: Set realistic goals.

* Spiritually:  Don’t be something you are not.  Go search inside.  Don’t take some hand-me-down version of who people have told you you are.  Find the real YOU.

* Physically:  Real workouts (walking is not a workout) test the limits of your body.  When you physically train, do not underestimate your capabilities.  Most people have a limit but they are nowhere close to reaching it.

* Real recovery (you must rest and repair just as intensely and routinely as you workout.  Sitting down on the couch for 30min is not what I mean.)

* Real food (MOST important rule of my nutrition:  the closer to the original the food is, the better. Processed garbage that has a list of 20+ ingredients that are man-made is not real to your body and will not be processed effectively).

**Practice silence**
 
**Sleep and restore. **

Sleep is more impactful to health then both physical exercise and nutrition.
 

**Be positive in mind and speech**

* Try daily to increase your positive self-talk as well as in conversations with others.  The effect is tremendous on all aspects of life.

* Never say “I can’t”

**Anytime-anywhere!**

Always have a bag with you (like a first aid kit) for a workout.  Clothes, tunes, shoes (if you wear them). 
 
**Don’t over-train **

More is not necessarily better and can be counterproductive.



**Get off the pills** 

Exercise can reduce the need for many medications-once you start an exercise program, be sure to re-evaluate the need for your medication –maybe you don’t need those depression or high-blood pressure pills anymore. If fitness came in a bottle, everybody would have a great body!
 
**BREATHE…**

70% of detoxification is breathing
 
**Go Barefoot **

No motion-controlling casts (AKA the shoe)

* Why Barefoot?  Fitness shoe manufacturers have developed advanced technology to cushion and control the motion in our feet and ankles.  Our feet have become weak and stiff through this technology. We can no longer support ourselves in movement because these shoes do not allow for articulation of joints.  We have lost flexibility, mobility, and balance.  Through disuse, our beautifully created bases have become imbalanced-many muscles atrophied and a few overdeveloped.

* With the use of a minimalist shoe (I recommend Vibram), one can restore this lost balance and strength.  Reducing pain and injuries to the feet, ankles, and knees.

* Be aware you should not go straight from a typical fitness shoe to a minimalist shoe without first strengthening the feet and ankles (you wouldn’t take your hands out of casts and do a handstand).  It would take long to repair and soon every fitness activity will be barefoot.
