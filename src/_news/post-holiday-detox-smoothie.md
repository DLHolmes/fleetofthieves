title: Post-Holiday Detox Smoothie

"This morning I woke up to the uncomfortable feeling of a weekend of over indulgence.  I enjoyed parties filled with fried potatoes, big portions, delicious desserts and little to no yoga.  I'm starting today with a green smoothie in hopes for setting the tone for a healthy last week of 2011.

There is no official recipe for my green smoothie; I simply use what I have around and this recipe can be altered.  Smoothies are a great way to use up browning bananas and bruised berries or peaches.

What you need:

Blender/Cuisinart

Banana

Spinach

Berries (fresh or frozen)

Other fruit (mangos, peaches, cherries etc.)

Maca Powder

Optional: Flax seed

I used to use almond  milk in my smoothies, but realized cold water can easily be substituted.  When I share with my kids, I always include milk as they are not huge milk drinkers and I  figure they can use the calcium.  My children do not like spinach, but they will drink it if it is hidden in a smoothie. 

Maca Powder is labeled as a Incan Superfood.  Maca root has been used to increase stamina, boost libido and combat fatigue.  It is nutrient dense and packed with vitamins, amino acids and essential minerals.  Maca Powder is organic, kosher, vegan and raw and has very little taste when a spoonful is added to the smoothie.

Although I haven't given up coffee completely, I have found Maca to provide energy similar or even better than a cup of Joe.  I also love to start my day with a green smoothie as I have gotten at least one serving of vegetables and fruit first thing in the morning.

I am sure today is going to be far from perfect in the healthy eating department as we are headed to Navy Pier for Winter Wonder Fest.  At least I began the morning with nutrients and vitamins. 

What do you put in your smoothies?"
