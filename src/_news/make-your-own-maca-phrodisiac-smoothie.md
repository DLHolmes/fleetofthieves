*Make Your Own Maca-phrodisiac Smoothie!*

By Rebecca Leffler @ http://www.mindbodygreen.com

Maca is a Peruvian aphrodisiac that helps to regulate hormones and is rich in nutrients like potassium, calcium, magnesium and high in protein.  
 
Maca provides a great energy boost, without the side effects of caffeine. This sweet love potion is a great way to start the day. Blend in a banana for an extra energy kick and more creaminess.

*Ingredients*

* 1/4 cup of hemp seeds or cashews (preferably soaked overnight)
* 1 cup of coconut water (Iâ€™m loving the Harmless Harvest brand right now)
* 1/2 cup of filtered water
* 1 Medjool date
* 2 teaspoons of Mesquite powder
* 1 (3g) scoop of  Mighty Maca powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of ginger powder and/or fresh ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla powder
* Optional: one banana

*Directions*

Blend until smooth.
