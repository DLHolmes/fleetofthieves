**Peruvian herb supports men's sexual performance**

So Valentine’s Day fell a bit flat...

If the romantic fireworks were really just fizzle and the main event was less than memorable, well, it can all be a little disappointing for both partners.

Sexual performance can make or break a romantic night, and is often associated with energy levels, stamina and sex drive.

It’s not surprising really when, for example, it’s estimated up to 52 percent of men in NZ over the age of 40 (946,000 men) may be affected.

These issues don’t just plague men over 40 as men sexually peak when they’re 19. An old herbal product has, however, managed to find its way back into modern science to help support male sexual performance.

A Peruvian herb called MACA (or Lepidium peruvianum chacon) is an edible root plant rich in nutrients including protein, vitamins and minerals. The herb has also been used for thousands of years by Peruvians to help support energy and stamina as well as sexual function. During the Inca Empire, its use was restricted to nobility, the clergy and privileged classes. It was also given as a prize to warriors.

 
With this knowledge, the Clinicians scientists looked into the properties of MACA and introduced a supplement scientifically proven to support sexual function and desire. Clinicians MACA Men’s Performance is now available in New Zealand.

They used an organic, premium grade form of MACA as the key ingredient derived from farms 14,000 feet above sea level in the Peruvian Andes that are free of pesticides and herbicides.

MACA has no known side effects and doesn’t interfere with reproductive hormone levels. Instead it acts as a natural energiser and helps to support mental and physical stamina.

Healthy men between 20 and 70 can use MACA to support sexual desire, general health and sexual well being, energy levels and their ability to handle stress, maintain stamina, endurance and athletic performance as well as support mental focus.
