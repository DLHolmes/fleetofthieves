title: Maca Rocks!
---
Ever heard of Maca? Well, it’s pretty awesome. It’s a true power root. It grows high in the Peruvian Andes and it’s the only food in the world that can grow at altitudes of 12000 feet.

It packs: Amino Acids, Calcium, Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamins C, E, B12, Iron, etc.

It has tons of benefits however I feel that these are the 3 biggest.

It’s been proven to cure chronic fatigue and also improves athletic performance; I add it to my protein shake in the mornings after my workout, because I feel it revitalizes me and provides the strength to get going without the need for coffee. It also has been proven to enhance memory and brain function. I’ve read articles where athletes use it as a substitute for steroids as

This is huge, ladies if you have issues with mood swings during PMS or hot flashes because of menopause and gentleman if you find yourself going through mood swings because of stress or fatigue (Honestly guys are moody often, we just don’t admit to it as much) then Maca is your answer.

The gist is that it enhances the endocrine system and all of the hormones it discharges. These hormones are what control your moods and if the endocrine system is balanced so will be your moods. Don’t ask me how, I’m not a doctor, I just know that’s what it does and it works trust me I take it.

I never knew how important the endocrine system was until I started taking Maca. Gentleman lets be real once we are past our 30’s our shit don’t work like it used to in our early 20’s. Back then erections came about every hour on the hour regardless of where you where, but once we pass our 30’s we start to save our powers for good. If we workout too hard or if we are over stressed from work, our powers are not as strong. It happens with age.

If you’ve never taken Maca then you’ll be happy that you read this, I’m not saying that it works like Viagra and you might hurt yourself, however I am saying that after a few days of taking it, it will strengthen your manhood and you will feel it, believe me. Also if you are having fertility issues, Maca has been proven to strengthen your little swimmers, in fact in South America doctors prescribe it to patients that are having these types of issues.

Ladies Maca will empower you in this department as well, as it will provide you with sexual stimulation which will ultimately keep you in a happier state.

You don’t need more than a small teaspoon of the gelatinized version of it which you can buy at your health store, it tastes kinda like butterscotch but stronger, I recommend drinking it in a juice that includes bananas to hide the taste a bit.

I hope you try it, I think its fun to try new things and let me know how you feel afterwards, I’d love to hear about it.
