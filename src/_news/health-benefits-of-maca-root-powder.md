### HEALTH BENEFITS OF MACA ROOT POWDER

*By Jaya Patel*

The most common reason people take maca root is to boost their energy, libido, and to balance emotions related to hormonal issues as well as a nutritional supplement. Maca root works with the hormonal system of your body to balance your testosterone, progesterone and estrogen.

### Why is maca root so powerful?

It is a superfood containing carotene, thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), ascorbic acid, niacin, and other vitamins. It has high levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and, potassium, as well as minor levels of copper, zinc, manganese, iron, selenium, and boron. It also has 11% per gram of protein and fatty acids. Because of its 18 amino acids, it is a complete form of protein for vegans and raw-foodists.

Peruvians do not need any scientific studies to prove the powerful effects of maca as it has been one of their traditional food for thousands of years. This root is consumed in various ways in Peru and ingrained deeply in the culture. It is used in baking, smoothies, and various other foods.

Maca can be taken in capsule form (with the powder in the capsule) or as a powder or as a concentrated extract. The capsules generally contain 500 mg of powder. Most people take it in powder form by blending it in smoothies or simply taking it by dissolving in water. I recommend in powder form so that your body absorbs it immediately. It does have a unique nutty flavor, a bit of an aftertaste but it's not strong and OK for most people. If you are sensitive to the taste then taking it in capsule form would be a better option for you.

### How much maca powder should you take?

It is different for everyone. I suggest if you take capsule form, try starting with 2 capsules per day, and do it consistently for a few days and then adjust from there. If taken in powder form, start with 2 teaspoons a day and adjust from there. Each individual is uniquely different and since this is a natural medicinal plant product, each person will need different amounts. I also suggest taking it in the middle of the afternoon around 2 pm when your hormones tend to be the lowest.

You should take a little precaution when you start taking maca. Some people have reported experiencing elevated heartbeat and insomnia from having excess energy (similar to taking too much caffeine). As mentioned before, take the recommended dosage of 1-3 teaspoons of powder daily and listen to your body and adjust accordingly.

Just as in any other medicinal plants, quality does matter. Make sure you buy organic and from a company that is committed to bringing the best organic fair-traded, sustainably produced Maca root product.
