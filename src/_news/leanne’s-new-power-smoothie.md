**Leanne’s new Power Smoothie!**

**By: Leanne Ely**

One of my very favorite things are smoothies and I’m a regular drinker of them; daily as a matter of fact.

I get asked quite a bit how to make a good one, what kind of blender to use and what kind of fiber to use.

I’ve actually made 3 videos making smoothies (yes, they’re all different) and it I’m already planning on making another. Yes, smoothies are that important!

I consider smoothies to be the perfect breakfast (or any other meal) in a glass. You’ve got your protein (whey, pea/rice blend or hemp), you’ve got your healthy fat (coconut milk), you’ve got your fiber (chia and Medi-bulk) and you have your power berries (phytonutriently rich, plus a bonus of extra fiber). Put that those ingredients altogether and you have a beautifully balanced and healthy meal. In a glass. To go even!

I’ve started adding a new power smoothie in the afternoon and I’m telling you, I feel great. It’s hardcore and not for the faint of heart. It’s entirely green and no, I didn’t blend up Kermit the Frog.

I did whip up some hemp, frozen and dried greens, fiber and coconut water though! Gives me an extra kick in the afternoon and it’s a hugely better choice than the coffee I was drinking before.

Here’s a recipe if you dare to go there!

* 6 ounces chilled coconut water
* 3 ounces frozen organic greens (organic spinach is easy)
* 1 scoop Mighty Maca Greens
* 1 scoop chia seeds

Put everything in a blender and give it a whir. Pour, drink and then congratulate yourself. That wasn’t easy!
