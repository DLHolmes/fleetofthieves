title: I'm Just Too Tired For Sex!
---
**"I'm just too tired for sex"... **

**Sound familiar?** Today's lifestyle is so demanding. If you're even remotely like the majority of individuals holding down a full time job, maybe looking after the kids at the same time, or taking care of the kids full time, or in some cases even more difficult scenario's, then there are plenty of times when you finally get to that time of the evening when you actually get 5 minutes to yourself or your partner, and you're too exhausted to even consider having sex. Just the thought of it can seem like too much effort. So in many cases you both just fall into bed and are asleep before your heads hit the pillow. And fatigue is just one factor contributing to a road block in many sex lives. What you need to understand first is that **you are not alone. **

Many factors can contribute to a lack of desire. Things such as prescription drugs, age (declining testosterone), pollution, and lack of time are just a few that I can think of off the top of my head but I'm sure many of you could write and tell me MANY more. The problem is when your desire starts to decline if your communication with your partner is lacking it can cause further problems with your relationship. Your partner may feel as though you just don't desire THEM. Or worse that you're having an affair and are getting it somewhere else. And trying to explain to a partner who just doesn't understand is very difficult and in turn, makes YOU think there's something wrong with you. 

If all this sounds even remotely familiar I am here to tell you... 

**THERE IS HOPE! **

There is a new herb, okay well it's not new it's actually over 2000 years old, but it's just now creating huge market demand. Why? This little Peruvian radish like herb is known as a powerful, strength, libido, and stamina enhancer. The name of this little herb is Maca. And we are going to predict that it's going to take over the supplement industry. Here are some of the benefits we've been able to source out: 

**Enhanced Energy** - The steady enhancement of both physical and mental energy Maca an ideal supplement for students, professionals, writers, athletes, and anybody else who needs a lift. The Peruvians have used it for centuries as a general energy tonic. The fact that Maca contains no stimulants, but obtains its benefits from vitamins and minerals, make it especially beneficial for individuals who suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Many people who use Maca also report increased mental clarity. 

**Increased Sexual Desire (Libido)** - Maca was well known in ancient times for enhancing sexual desire, increasing libido, vitality, stamina and sexual performance. 

**Hormone Balancing** - Maca has also been shown to be effective in reducing mood swings associated with PMS and Menopause. The herb works through the hypothalamus and pituitary to help insure balanced and healthy hormone levels in the body. **Maca helps promote sexual functioning** and, in general, brings about all the benefits of healthy, balanced hormone levels in the body. 

We think this is going to really take off once individuals realize that they can get natural energy without stimulants AND an increase in libido not to mention the many other benefits of this herb.
