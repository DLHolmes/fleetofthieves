title: Natural Remedies to Help Hot Flashes
---
Hot flashes are something no woman out there likes to deal with and these unpleasant bodily experiences can actually occur during many stages of life for women of different ages. Hormonal changes can cause a rapid rise in body temperature triggering hot flashes, which increases your heart rate which can also make you stressed and anxious, not to mention miserable!

Getting your hormones in line is one way to manage your hot flashes, but that’s much easier said than actually done. What you eat can have a large influence on your hormones and how often hot flashes occur, if at all. Some  food, herbs, and lifestyle choices may actually be able to provide relief or significantly reduce the times hot flashes occur.

Here are some natural remedies to help reduce the likelihood of hot flashes that are much better for you than chemical-based hormones that may likely damage your health later on.

### 1. Maca Root

Maca Root

Maca root is a well-known superfood from Peru known to boost the libido, but it’s overall great for you and your hormones, not just your sex drive.  Maca acts as an adaptogen in the body, so think of it as a balance beam.  If your body isn’t producing enough of certain types of hormones or producing too many, maca can help your body gain the balance that is needed, or at least make a large difference in helping you achieve that balance. It also helps aid in energy and overall mood thanks to its wide variety of amino acids. You can either take it as a powder (the most natural way to use this food) or use it in supplement form. Maca is being used in many natural over the counter remedies for hot flashes now due to its spectacular effects on hormones. It can be bought raw or gelatanized, which just removes some of the starch found in this healthy root. Try a teaspoon a day and see how you do. Too much isn’t needed, so find the dose that’s right for you, with no more than a tablespoon daily. You’ll love its natural, butterscotch caramel taste!
