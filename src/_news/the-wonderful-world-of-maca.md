**The Wonderful World Of Maca**

### A HUMBLE PERUVIAN ROOT

Have you tried maca powder yet? I have been adding a small amount to my smoothies and really like it. I definitely notice an increase in energy that lasts the whole day when I add it to a morning smoothie. Maca is a root vegetable related to the common radish and has been a staple in the Peruvian Andes for thousands of years. Maca grows at an elevation of 11,000 – 14,000 feet making it the highest altitude grown food in the world. Because of the extreme growing conditions in a harsh, cold climate, maca has developed wonderful character and has properties making it an amazing super-food with many benefits. Dried maca powder contains more than 10% protein, nearly 20 amino acids and 7 essential amino acids.

I not only like all the benefits of adding maca to my diet but I also love the taste! It has kind of a malty, strong taste so you don’t need much. It is particularly tasty with raw cacao in treats and smoothies. It’s somewhat expensive but my bag lasted a long time. The first bag I bought from Whole Foods and then I bought it in a box online which I found to be cheaper. Give maca a try and reap the wonderful benefits!
