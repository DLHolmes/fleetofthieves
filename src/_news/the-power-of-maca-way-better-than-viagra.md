title: 'The Power of Maca, way better than Viagra'
---
The NY Times has put together a fantastic photo essay on the powerful root Maca and the work of Chris Kilham - the Medicine Hunter, (thx Maxine).

The photo essay is part of a longer article titled, On a Remote Path to Cures. The article has some great information on maca including how recent research has shown that it "improves stamina, reduces the risk of prostate cancer and increases the motility, volume and quality of sperm."

Sort of like Viagra except NOT. Maca actually works and doesn't carry any of the known or unknown risks of V!@g(a. 

And you certainly don't get Maca spam - although... if I HAD to get spam, I'd much rather prefer Maca spam.

Here's a little more on Maca from DW's site:


Are there any side effects or interactions? In toxicity studies conducted in the U.S., maca showed absolutely no toxicity and no adverse pharmacological effects. In animal studies, the more maca animals consume, the stronger and more sexually active they become.

Historical or traditional use: Maca's history as a powerful strength and stamina enhancer and libido-fertility herb stretches back well over five hundred years. Maca is a powerful adaptogen, which means it has the ability to balance and stabilize the body's systems. Maca can raise low blood pressure AND lower high blood pressure. Adaptogens also boost immunity and harmonize the body's overall vitality. Rather than addressing a specific symptom, adaptogens are used to improve the overall adaptability of the whole system.
