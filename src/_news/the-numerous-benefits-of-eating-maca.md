There are many benefits to taking Maca Herb Supplement and I will now explain some of them to you.

Maca Root is highly nutritious. It is rich in essential nutrients (especially iodine, iron, calcium, selenium and magnesium), essential fatty acids, fibre, sugars, protein, amino acids, vitamins and carbohydrates.

It is believed to act as an aphrodisiac and so helps with sexual performance. It boosts the libido in men and women. There has been chemical research that has found that within Maca root a chemical called p-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate exists which has aphrodisiac properties.

Maca is known to help with sterility and other reproductive sexual disorders like erectile dysfunction, impotence and may increase seminal volume and sperm motility because it balances hormonal activity. The hormonal balancing qualities may also have something to do with balancing the adrenal gland hormones. It enhances sexual performance and endurance. Research claims that with women it increases libido, boosts sex drives and may enhance fertility because of its glucosinolate content.

According to clinical studies Maca helps with premenstrual problems and discomforts (PMS) plus menopausal symptoms by promoting healthy oestrogen and progesterone levels. Maca does not contain plant hormones. It has plant sterols which act as chemical triggers to help the body produce higher level of hormones normally found in the sex and age of the person taking it.

In 1997 a New York doctor, Viana Muller introduced Maca to medics practising Complementary Alternative Medicine at a conference on Anti-Ageing. Dr. Muller explained that Maca Root has been eaten by Peruvians for many years to regulate fertility, hormonal imbalances and menstrual irregularities. Also it helps with menopausal symptoms like loss of energy and libido, temporary depression, hot flashes, vaginal dryness and osteoporosis.

In athletes, Maca is eaten to boost endurance and increase energy and stamina. It can also help with chronic fatigue syndrome restoring lost vitality and vigour. Maca enhances memory and encourages mental alertness. A long time ago, Spanish chroniclers described Inca warriors who ate boiled Maca Root before going to battle. It would increase their strength and also preserved their energy stores. It is still seen as a beneficial fatigue and lethargy fighter. It helps with memory loss and other disorders which can be caused from not having enough energy.

Maca can reduce thyroidal symptoms. If someone has hypothyroidism which is an under-active thyroid, it is more than likely caused by an hormonal imbalance. This is because the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This in turn, slows down the body’s functions and can lead to lots of physical disorders. A leading cause of hypothyroidism is a deficiency of the chemical element iodine which is a major component of thyroid hormones. The high iodine content and hormone balancing properties within Maca can improve hypothyroidism.

The herb’s rich iron content means that is considered beneficial to people suffering with anaemia. The immune system can be boosted and strengthened by Maca because of its phytochemical contents and so helps the body fight off harmful or foreign substances that may try to damage it. Serious invasive infection can be combated by the glucosinolates found in Maca Root according to current studies.

During stressful situations or times that demand strenuous and demanding activities, Maca is thought to be an adaptogen or agent which balances and normalises bodily functions and systems helping the body to adapt and restore it to an overall sense of well being.
