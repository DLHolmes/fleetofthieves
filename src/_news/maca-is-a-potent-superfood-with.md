**Maca is a potent superfood with a 5,000+ year history** yet has only been recently introduced to the Western world. Hailed as “Nature’s Viagra” and “Peruvian Ginseng” maca has a lot to offer both genders of all ages, as well as boasting a wide and impressive range of nutritional properties. Read on for more information about this wonder food and how you can bring its potency and multi-faceted health benefits into your diet.

**What is maca?**

Maca (Lepidium Meyenii) is a tuberous perennial plant that grows high in the Andean Mountains at altitudes of between 11,000 and 14,000 feet. Colour-wise it looks like a potato, but it is shaped like a large radish. It grows as a mat-like stem system. Its roots are the parts that are dried and stored and made into powder, which is how we buy it today.

**Maca facts**

* The maca plant is related to the radish.
* Maca is the only plant that can survive at this altitude because of the extreme weather conditions there – i.e. brutally hot temperatures by day and freezing cold temperatures by night.
* Maca is technically an herb but is eaten as a food.
* The root is approximately 8cm in diameter and of a pale white colour.
* Although it is perennial it is reproduced by seeds which require around 7-9 months for harvesting.
