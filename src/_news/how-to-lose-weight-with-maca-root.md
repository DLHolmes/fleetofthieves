Maca root is widely grown in Peru and has been an old-aged food for the Peruvians. It is typically made as a concoction in cookies, cakes, hot porridge, chips and blender drinks. It is scientifically referred to as Lepidium Meyenii, a plant which produces a radish-like root.

Maca root is packed full of essential nutrients needed by the body thus making it a superfood. Many claims of the health benefits of maca root, ranging from boosting immune system to increasing endurance. It is also widely known to improve adrenal gland function, boost fertility and increase libido. According to a Doctor Hugo Malaspina, M.D., a cardiologist practicing a complementary medicine in Lima, Peru, that he has been recommending maca to his patients for 10 years, after he discovered a good result of a group of sexually older men who were taking maca.

This superfood is rich in beneficial nutrients such as vitamin B2, B6, and B12, fiber, iron, niacin, calcium, iodine, manganese, potassium, zinc and amino acids.

Furthermore, maca helps women to achieve a feminine shape and weight loss. It is also rumored to increase women’s booty size.
