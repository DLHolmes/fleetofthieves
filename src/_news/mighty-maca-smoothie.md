Mighty Maca Smoothie - From MINDBODY360.com

I first heard of the superfood, Maca, while listening to raw foods guru David Wolfe. For those of you who have not heard of him, he is wild. Wildly enthusiastic that is. Raw foods is his religion and even though I’m a card carrying member of the “Need Some Cooked Food” crowd, his passion almost made me go raw! In his words, superfoods have the ” … ability to tremendously increase the vital force and energy of one’s body … boosting the immune system, elevating serotonin production, enhancing sexuality, cleansing, lowering inflammation, and alkalizing the body.” What’s not to like? His TOP SUPERFOODS and TONIC HERBS are: Cacao (Raw Chocolate), Goji Berries, Maca, Hemp Products in their RAW form, Spirulina and AFA Blue-Green Algae, Bee Products, Camu Berry, Sea Vegetables, and Medicinal Mushrooms.

I’ve been curious about Maca for awhile, as it’s known to specifically increase energy, boost libido, balance hormones, and has good protein and fiber. So I finally bought a nice little pouch of it and started test driving various smoothie concoctions. Now, Maca has a particular flavor. In large doses it’s just too overpowering for me. So after some trial and error, I stumbled upon a fantastic recipe that also includes Hemp powder, and Cacao powder. Triple play! The result? Energy. Really good energy. I just feel good. And, the taste is seriously delicious. Here’s the recipe:

10 oz. non-daily milk (I used Hemp Milk)

1 Scoop of Maca

1 TBSP Hemp Powder

1 TBSP Cacao Powder

1/2 TBSP Maple Syrup

1/2 tsp Vanilla

1 Banana — frozen in chunks

Dash of sea salt

Blast in a blender. Makes 1 serving.
