**Spirulina** is a spring spiraled blue-green algae that is a rich source of nutrients.  It contains up to **70% protein** which is an uncommon finding in nature.

It also contains **B-complex vitamins, phycocyanin, chlorophyll, beta-carotene, vitamin E, and numerous minerals.** It actually contains more **beta-carotene** than carrots! It is said to possess a variety of medicinal uses, including as an **antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, weight loss aid, and cholesterol lowering agent.**

The Aztecs were known to harvest and ingest “blue mud” which contained **spirulina.**

The natives to the Sahara Desert including the Kanembu people, also harvested **spirulina** from Lake Chad and included it in their diet as dihe.

**Spirulina** was shown in studies to have antineoplastic activity by down regulating pro-apoptotic genes which allow cancer to continue to grow unlike normal cells of the body. It was shown in a several studies to reduce cholesterol in hyperlipidemic patients. In patients with heart disease it is cardioprotective by blocking the mechanism in the body which causes clotting leading to further blockage of the arteries of the heart and by blocking the immunopathological process by which artheroscerotic blockages are created.

**Spirulina** contains Immolina, a compound which activates cells of the innate immune system and suggests that oral consumption of this polysaccharide can enhance components within both the mucosal and systemic immune systems.

#### Scientific discoveries

Antiviral

In a study on human T cells, **spirulina** extract inactivated HIV-1 infectivity directly. HIV-1 replication was halted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Langerhans cells.

In a separate study research indicated that is has antiviral properties against herpes simplex 1, herpes simplex 2, and HIV.

Promotes a healthy GI tract

When observing patients with chronic catarrhal colitis and irritable bowel syndrome there was a 78% deficiency in selenium. Supplementation of **spirulina** resulted in a two-fold decrease in the number of selenium deficient patients.

In rats it was shown to inhibit pancreatic lipase leading to a decreased absorption of lipids.

Anti-neoplastic

**Spirulina** is a potential anti-hepatocellular carcinoma agent. Studies showed a down regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax by c-phycocyanin found in **spirulina** in the cells of hepatocellular carcinoma

C-phycocyanin also produced induction of apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells.

Nephroprotective

Phycocyanin was shown to protect the integrity of the renal cell by stabilizing the free radical mediated LPO and protein carbonyl as well as low molecular weight antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes in renal cells. 

In research done on rats, high cholesterol levels induced by a high sugar (Fructose) diet were lowered when supplemented with **spirulina.**  It especially lowered the serum triglyceride level.

It also indicated a hypocholesterolemic effect in patients studied with hyperlipidemic nephrotic syndrome. Helps to prevent artherosclerosis.
In patients studied with ischemic heart disease **spirulina** had a correcting effect to cascade procoagulation and imunopathological reactions characteristic of the artherosclerotic process.

Promotes immune system resulting in anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties.

**Spirulina** contains Immolina, a compound which activates cells of the innate immune system and suggests that oral consumption of this polysaccharide can enhance components within both the mucosal and systemic immune systems.

The production of IgA and IL-6 from peyer’s patches was enhanced 2-fold.  
INF-gamma production from spleen cells was increased 4-fold.
Immolina is thought to activate THP-1 human cells in a manner that is consistent with the recruitment of diverse populations of leukocytes in response to inflammatory and infectious signals.

It has been proven experimentally in vivo and in vitro that it is effective to treat certain allergies, anemia, cancer, hepatotoxicity, viral and cardiovascular disease, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, immunodeficiency and inflammatory processes.  Several of these activities are attributed to many of its components:

* Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
* Alpha-tocopherol
* Phenol compounds
* Beta-carotene
* Phycocyanin
* Ca-spirulan

Flame atomic absorption spectrometry demonstrated that spirulina is high in trace elements such as magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium, and copper.
