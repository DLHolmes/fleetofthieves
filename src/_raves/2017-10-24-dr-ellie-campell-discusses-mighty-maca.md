I have a wellness practice and prescribe nutrition therapies daily. While I love the idea of "green drinks", they all taste like freshly mowed grass to me! Dr Cabeca convinced me to try her product, and I was truly AMAZED! It is absolutely delicious and enhances the flavor of both my protein shakes and fruit/veggie smoothies. Objectively, we have seen reduction in symptom scores especially for peri-menopausal women. Soon there will be scientific studies published on its efficacy. I take this myself an have noticed increase in energy, motivation and mental clarity. Thank you for the wisdom and science going in to your product, Dr Cabeca!

Mighty Maca is MARVELOUS!
