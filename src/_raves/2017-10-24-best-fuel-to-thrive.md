MMG has been a part of my daily lifestyle for several years and I consider it a vital part of a my training. I struggled to find a good quality green drink that did not taste like yard debris for myself and my clients. I am so thankful for Dr.Cabeca's MMG. I drank it through both of my pregnancies and now by little ones enjoy it - since they are 2 and 3 it says alot for this products taste. I take a scoop of MMG first thing in the morning before my workout to fuel my body with quality nutrients and at night after my evening training to help my body recover and repair. I can feel a huge difference in inflammation and overall energy levels if I miss even a day. You only have one life and one body -why not give it the best fuel to thrive.
