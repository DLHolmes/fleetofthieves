While I love the concept of green drinks, I find them tough to be compliant with for the long haul.

Dr. Cabeca assured me that I would like the taste of Mighty Maca and I honestly didn't believe her. She proved me wrong! I actually LIKE drinking this one and am now a big fan. I love the effect on my energy and skin too! This is the one that I can happily recommend to my clients and know that they will thank me for!
